## During
### Events

[[Bodoh Buffin]] approached [[Arcafang]]'s door but hesitated upon realizing he was a Wolfkind. Retreating, he then knocked on [[Ntyss]]'s door, offering breakfast containing seasoned wolf meat.

[[Max]] noticed four identical tablets of breakfast and immediately cast [[Poison Spray]] on the meat. He complained about the lack of nutrition in [[Campaign/Settlements/Sproute Village|Sproute Village]], particularly the absence of bread.

As a chilling wind swept through, [[Max]] was drawn to his own room, where the figure he'd made a deal with appeared, dropping a chain with a purple stone attached before vanishing. Using his staff, [[Max]] picked up the gem.

Meanwhile, [[Arcafang]] knocked on [[Fanlyn]]'s door, finding her still mourning from the previous day's events. [[Bodoh Buffin]] returned with another tablet of food, offering a salad containing healing herbs, which were inedible but meant for healing purposes.

Exiting, [[Max]] and [[Arcafang]] encountered [[Laeroth]], [[Darling]],[[Stretch]], and other villagers discussing money matters and [[Laeroth]]'s group. The kingdom troupe from the day before wanted [[Laeroth]] and [[Darling]] to meet Lord Sequet regarding trading routes in the west.

Following a villager, [[Arcafang]] obtained a map of the continent while the party discussed helping with disrupted trading routes due to the [[Bandit Camp]] in the south. Before deciding, [[Max]] and [[Arcafang]] agreed to consult the rest of the party.

Aleesia mentioned her daughter might be at old Lonnie's place. [[Fanlyn]] transformed into a spider to investigate, discovering her daughter's missing arm from a plushie.

[[Max]] confronted Lonnie, who admitted to being paid to let someone go before succumbing to poison. Following footprints, the party found a [[goblin]] camp. [[Arcafang]] and [[Fanlyn]] calmed two wolves, leading to combat and victory for the party.

The wolves consumed the goblins' corpses as the party fed them treats before continuing to explore. In the caves, they encountered more goblins, a dead horse, and an orc using the goblins as toys.

After defeating the orc, they found [[Lina Enmar]] unconscious and waited for her to wake up outside the cave. They also learned that there were some 4 papers in a chest, all holding a similar message that the orc looked for a new wife. 

### Travel & Rest

The party travelled for one hour to reach the goblin camp.

### Loot, Rewards & Purchases
