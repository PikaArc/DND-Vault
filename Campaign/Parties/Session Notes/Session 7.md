## During
### Events

The day began with everyone awakening to a new adventure. [[Max]]'s tarot card reading took a dark turn when he was possessed and attacked [[Ntyss]]. Meanwhile, [[Fanlyn]] tended to the horses, unaware of the chaos unfolding. The discovery of [[Darling]], rooted to the ground, added to the mystery. [[Fanlyn]] identified ancient roots originating from an 800-year-old tree, stirring more questions.

A city guard approached, bringing news of [[Sin]]'s possession of an elixir and his journey from [[Sproute Village]]. When questioned, tensions rose, leading to a fatal confrontation. Amidst the chaos, [[John Lancaster]] emerged as the village chief.

Journeying westward, the party encountered a guarded outpost where [[Sin]] was found chained. Using a false identity, [[Fanlyn]] navigated the situation while they sought permission to enter the city. [[Sin]] pleaded for help, setting off a chain of events.

An ill-fated card draw by [[Ntyss]] transformed everyone into sheep, causing a frantic escape. Eventually, [[Sin]] and [[Max]] fled while the rest faced off against [[Duarte]], leading to their reluctant arrest.

With [[Max]]'s departure, the party's dynamics shifted, leaving them facing uncertain fates within the confines of the city.

### Travel & Rest

The party travelled to the outpost to the west near the village and took a long rest there as they wait for the carriage to arrive next day
