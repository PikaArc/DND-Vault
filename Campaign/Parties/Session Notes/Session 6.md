## During
### Events

During the next session, the party traversed for one hour to reach the goblin camp where the wolves dragged the dead goblins into the cave. [[Lina Enmar]] woke up amidst the aftermath. They then returned to the village with [[Lina Enmar]] in tow, only to find it eerily deserted except for the bandits preparing to execute the villagers.

In a tense moment, [[Fanlyn]] assisted Lina in sneaking into her house through a window while [[Arcafang]], [[Ntyss]], and [[Max]] negotiated with [[Chase]] about the situation. Tragically, [[Laeroth]] fell victim to [[Heinrik Ragnor Le Doux IV]].

[[Max]] transformed into a rat using Wild Shape to scout ahead but was caught by one of the archers, leading to a confrontation with [[Heinrik Ragnor Le Doux IV]] and the initiation of combat.

The party heard a mysterious message in their minds, accusing them of being the perpetrators behind someone's sister's demise. Celestial chains restrained [[Fanlyn]], [[Chase]], and [[Sin]], while two angelic figures, [[Mae]] and [[Leae]], appeared.

[[Ntyss]], instead of attempting to reason with the angels, unleashed a barrage of scathing remarks towards them, turning the tide of conversation into a heated exchange. As [[Ntyss]] continued to verbally spar with the celestial beings, the rest of the party retreated to regroup with the fleeing villagers.

After a brief hiatus, the party reconvened. [[Max]] indulged in alcohol, while [[Sin]] and [[Ntyss]] imbibed to a lesser extent. [[Sin]] discovered [[Laeroth]]'s [[mimic]], Poly, under a table in the tavern, and with [[Ntyss]] and [[Max]]'s assistance, they caught and tamed it, obtaining an elixir.

Poly consumed [[Laeroth]]'s corpse, leading to [[Laeroth]]'s sudden reappearance, revealing the grim news of [[Darling]]'s demise and the missing heart bearing the symbol of the Church.

Additionally, [[Max]] had a clandestine conversation with the necromancer, who expressed a keen interest in obtaining a sample of the potion Laeroth possessed.

Amidst the ensuing turmoil, [[Arcafang]] stormed into the inn, [[Fanlyn]] sought solace with the horses before bedding down with them, [[Max]] retreated indoors, and [[Ntyss]] found rest standing still.

### Travel & Rest

Returning to the village consumed about 30 minutes of our time. Meanwhile, [[Arcafang]], [[Max]], and [[Fanlyn]] ventured alongside the villagers, their absence spanning 20 minutes before rejoining us.

The party fell asleep in various places to start a long rest.
